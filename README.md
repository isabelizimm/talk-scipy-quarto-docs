##### Isabel Zimmerman, Posit PBC || SciPy 2024

To effectively share scientific results, we must blend narrative text and code to create polished, interactive output. Quarto is an open-source scientific publishing system to help you communicate with others through code. Quartodoc is a Python package that generates function references within Quarto websites. Together, these tools create beautiful documentation that is reproducible, accessible, and easily editable.

This talk will include examples of Quarto in actionâ€“from simple blogs to expansive Python package documentation including web-assembly powered live examples. Listeners will walk away knowing how to Quarto websites, when to use quartodoc, and how these tools create better documentation.
